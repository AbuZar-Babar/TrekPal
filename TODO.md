# Task: Fix Admin App Token Authentication Issue

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Update admin-portal/src/modules/auth/store/authSlice.ts to store the returned JWT token (response.token) in localStorage instead of the input firebaseToken.
- [ ] Verify the changes by testing the login process (enter 'admin' as token and check if it proceeds to dashboard).
- [ ] Update this TODO.md to mark steps as completed and finalize the task.
